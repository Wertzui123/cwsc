# C WebSocket Client (CWSC)
A bare but useful single-file WebSocket client library written in C.

This implementation is very roughly based on [boomanaiden154's WebSocket library](https://github.com/boomanaiden154/websocket) as well as the [`net.websocket`](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/vlib/net/websocket) module of the V standard library.

Moreover, it uses [TLSe](https://github.com/eduardsui/tlse) for TLS (previously known as SSL) support.
